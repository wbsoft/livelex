"""
This module provides QSyntaxHighlighterMixin.

This class can be combined with QSyntaxHighlighter to use livelex lexing
with QSyntaxHighlighter.

You should inherit from both Qt's QSyntaxHighlighter and this 
QSyntaxHighlighterMixin, and implement the get_format() method.

This method is called with the action of every token in the current line,
and should return a QTextCharFormat, a QColor or a QFont; anything that
QSyntaxHighlighter.setFormat() allows.

For example:

    class Highlighter(livelex.qthighlight.QSyntaxHighlighterMixin, QSyntaxHighlighter):
        def get_format(self, action):
            return self.our_text_formats[action]

    h = Highlighter(qtextdocument)

The Highlighter instance has all the features of livelex.Document, to access
the tokens, etc.

This module itself does not depend on Qt.
