"""
An experimental query module.


Using this module you can query the token tree to find tokens and contexts,
based on lexicons and/or actions and text contents. You can chain calls
in a XPath-like fashion.

This module supplements the various find_xxx methods of every Context object.
After iterating the three with this query module, you will probably still
use the other navigational possibilities of the tree structure. Also depending
on the design of the Language structure.

The basic query starts at the `query` property of a Context object, which
selects all the nodes of that Context.

Then you can narrow down the search using `tokens`, `contexts`, `('text')` or
`(lexicon)`, `has_not`, `[n]`, `[n:n]`, `[action]`, `[action, action]`,
`startingwith()`, `endingwith()`, `containing()`, `matching()`, `uniq`,
`in_action()`,  `in_lexicon()`, and the corresponding `not_` counterparts, and
`__getitem__` and `is_not()`.

You can navigate using `children`, `all`, `next`, `prev`, `right`, `left`, and
`parent`.


Examples:

Find all tokens that are the first child of a Context with bla lexicon:

    root.query.all(MyLang.bla)[0]


Find (in Xml) all attributes with name 'name' that are in a <bla> tag:

    root.query.all[Name.Tag]("bla").next('name')


Find all tags containing "hi" in their text nodes:

    root.query.all[Name.Tag].next.next[Text].containing('hi')


Find all comments that have TODO in it:

    root.query.all[Comment].containing('TODO')


A query is a generator, you can iterate over the results. For debugging
purposes, there are also the list(), pick(), count() and dump() methods.

    for attrs in q.all[Name.Tag]('origin').right:
        for atr in attrs.query[Name.Attribute]:
            print(atr)


Summary of the query methods:

For debugging:

    count()
        Just prints the number of results in the result set

    dump()
        dump()s the full result nodes to stdout

    list()
        aggregate the results in a list

    pick()
        just pick the first result, or a default if no results


Selecting nodes:

    all
        select all descandant nodes, depth-first, in order. First it yields the
        context, then its children.

    children
        select all the direct children of the current nodes

    parent
        select the parent of all current nodes. This can yield double
        occurrences of nodes in the list. (Use uniq to fix that.)

    next, prev
        select the next or previous token, if any

    right, left
        select the right or left sibling, if any

    (lexicon), __call__(lexicon)
        select the Contexts with that lexicon

    has_not(lexicon)
        select the Contexts that have a different lexicon

    ("text"), __call__("text")
        select the Tokens with exact that text

    has_not("text")
        select the Tokens that have different text

    startingwith("text"), not_startingwith("text")
        select the Tokens that do start (or not) with the specified text

    endingwith("text"), not_endingwith("text")
        select the Tokens that do end (or not) with the specified text

    containing("text"), not_containing("text")
        select the Tokens that contain (or not) specified text

    matching("regex"), not_matching("regex")
        select the Tokens that match (or not) the specified regular epression
        (using re.search, the expression can match anywhere unless you use
        ^ or $ characters).

    tokens
        select only the tokens

    contexts
        select only the contexts

    range(start=0, end=None)
        select only the nodes that fully fit in the range

    [int], __getitem__(int)
        select the nth child (if available) of each Context node
        (supports negative indices)

    [slice]
        select the specified slice of each Context node

    [action], [action, action<, action> ...]
        select the Tokens that have one of the specified actions

    in_action(*actions)
        select tokens if their action belongs in the realm of one of the
        specified StandardActions

    not_in_action(*actions)
        select tokens whose action does not inherit of one of the specified
        StandardActions

    in_lexicon(*lexicons)
        somewhat supplemental to (), yield the Context nodes if they
        have one of the specified lexicons

    not_in_lexicon(*lexicon)
        select the Context nodes that do not have one of the specified
        lexicons.

    uniq
        Removes double occurrences of Tokens or Contexts, which can happen
        e.g. when selecting the parent of all nodes
