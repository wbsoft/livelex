"""
The action module defines Action and its subclasses.

If an instance of Action is encountered in a rule, its filter_actions() method
is called to yield a (pos, text action) tuple. Normally the filter_actions()
method simply calls back the filter_actions() method of the lexer with the new
action, which could again be an Action instance.

Nesting is possible in most cases, only some actions require the match object
to be present; and such actions can't be used as default action, or inside
subgroup_actions.

An Action object always holds all actions it is able to return in the actions
attribute. This is done so that it is possible to know all actions a Language
can generate beforehand, and e.g. translate all the actions in a Language to
other objects, which could even be methods or functions.
