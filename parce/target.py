    A Target has two attributes:

        ``pop``
            zero or negative integer, indicating how may contexts to pop
            off the current context.

        ``push``
            a list of lexicons that need to be created. A lexicon may be None,
            indicating that the same lexicon needs to be pushed.

    Targets can be added and be applied in once if desired.
    A Target evaluates to None if pop == 0 and push is the empty list.

    A Target is instantiated with the list of targets in a rule.
