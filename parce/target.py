The target module defines targets that depend on the match object from the
lexer.

Instead of zero or more targets (which may be lexicons or integers), one
DynamicTarget instance can be given as DynamicTarget in a rule. Its target()
method is then called to return the desired tuple of targets.

    The possible targets are in the targets attribute.

    converted to a single-item list.
