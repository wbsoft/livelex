"""
This module contains utility functions to further digest a tree structure
originating from the Css parser in the parce.lang.css module.

The module will be used by the theme module.

Workflow:

    1. load a mixed list of Rule or Condition instances from a file, using
       ``load_rules()``, or create one from a tree using ``get_rules()``

       You can chain multiple lists from different sources.

    2. filter out the Condition instances, either using or ignoring the rules
       in the conditions. Currently filter_rules lets everything through; but
       filters to implement @media, @document, @supports queries could be
       written.

    3. Use ``sort_rules()`` to sort the rules on specificity. You can store
       the resulting list of rules to use it multiple times.

    4. Use a ``select`` method (currently only ``select_class``, but more
       can be implemented) to select rules based on their selectors.

    5. Use ``combine_properties()`` to combine the properties of the selected
       rules to get a dictionary of the CSS properties that apply.

Example::

    >>> import parce.css
    >>> rules = parce.css.load_rules("parce/themes/default.css")
    >>> rules = parce.css.filter_rules(rules)
    >>> combine_properties(select_class(sort_rules(rules), 'comment'))
    {'font-style': [<Context Css.identifier at 1037-1043 (1 children)>],
     'color': [<Token '#666' at 1056:1060 (Literal.Color)>]}
