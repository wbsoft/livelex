"""
The Formatter uses a Theme to highlight text according to the token's
``action`` attribute. The action is mapped to a TextFormat by the theme.

When a MetaTheme is used, a Formatter is capable of switching Theme
as the MetaTheme provides a special theme for a certain embedded language.

All kinds of text formatting and/or highlighting can be implemented by using
or inheriting of Formatter. If you need to convert the TextFormats from the
theme to something else, you can provide a factory to Formatter to do that.

If you need more special behaviour, you can inherit from Formatter and
reimplement ``format_ranges()``, to do other things or to use a different
FormatContext.
