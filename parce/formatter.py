This module provides the Formatter class.

Holds a Theme the information from a CSS file and can it provide the
formatting for every standard action, a Formatter is used to actually do
something with a theme. A Formatter can convert TextFormat instances from a
Theme to something you can use, caches those objects and provides a way to
apply formatting to a range of Tokens.

As a special feature, Formatter has a special method ``add_language()`` to
add a language class with its own Theme. The actual theme to use is then
chosen based on the lexicon of the token's Context, so an embedded language
can have its own color scheme.

For example::

    th = Theme.byname('default')     # use the formats from 'default.css'
    f = Formatter(th)
    f.add_language(parce.lang.xml.Xml, Theme("my_funky_xml.css"))

Tokens that originate from lexicons from the Xml language then use the colors
or text formats from my_funky_xml.css, while other tokens are shown in the
colors of the default stylesheet.

If you set ``f.subtheme_window_enabled`` to True (which it is by default),
some formatters can set the window properties for a subtheme to the region of
tokens originating from that theme, enabling an even more advanced
colorization scheme.

    A factory can be set that maps the TextFormats from the theme to
    something else if desired, before they are cached. A factory might
    return None, indicating that no particular formatting is set for
    that action.

    A Formatter is instantiated with a theme that it will use, but it is
    possible to add other Themes for specific languages using add_language().

    If the subtheme_window_enabled instance variable is set to True (the
    default), the property_ranges yielded for sub-languages have the window()
    textformat for that language's Theme in the window attribute, which is
    None otherwise.  This can be used to highlight languages inside other
