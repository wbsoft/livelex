This module provides Indenter to indent a Document.

To adapt the indenting behaviour, you only need to implement the
``indent_events()`` method.

The following events can be yielded (simply constants):

    IS_BLANK:
        this is a blank line

    CURRENT_INDENT, string:
        the current indent string this line has

    INDENT:
        next line should be indented a level

    DEDENT:
        next line should be dedented a level. (If this event occurs before
        INDENT or REGULAR_TEXT, the current line can be dedented.)

    ALIGN, pos:
        when yielded after INDENT, allows the indenter to position
        text exactly instead of using the default indent

    REGULAR_TEXT:
        further DETENT events will not dedent the current line anymore.

    PREFER_INDENT, string:
        use this indent for the current line, but do not change the current
        indent for the next line.
