"""
This module provides Indenter to indent a Document.

To adapt the indenting behaviour, you only need to implement the
:meth:`AbstractIndenter.indent_events` method.

The following events can be yielded (simply module constants):

    ``BLANK``:
        this is a blank line, the current indent level is not changed

    ``CURRENT_INDENT, string``:
        the current indent string this line has.

    ``INDENT`` [``, string``]:
        next line should be indented a level. If string is given, that indent
        is used instead of the default indent (relatively to the start of the
        text in the current line excluding the current indent).

    ``NO_INDENT``:
        the indent of this line may not be changed at all, e.g. because it is
        part of a multiline string.

    ``DEDENT``:
        next line should be dedented a level. (If this event occurs before
        ``INDENT`` or ``NO_DEDENT``, the current line can be dedented.)

    ``NO_DEDENT``:
        further ``DEDENT`` events will not dedent the current line anymore, but
        rather affect the indentation of the next line.

    ``PREFER_INDENT``, ``string``:
        use this indent for the current line, but do not change the indent
        level or the current indent for the next line.

.. py:attribute:: block

    The text block (line)

.. py:attribute:: is_blank

    True if this is a blank line.

.. py:attribute:: indent

    The current indent string (probably consisting of spaces and tabs).

.. py:attribute:: allow_indent

    True if the indent of this block may be changed.

.. py:attribute:: indenters

    A list of string or None items. Every item means an indent level, if the
    item is not None, it is the string to use, otherwise a default indent
    string is used according to the indenter preferences.

.. py:attribute:: dedenters

    A named tuple Dedenters(start, end) of the levels that should be decreased
    at the beginning of this block, and after the end of this block.

.. py:attribute:: prefer_indent

    The indent to be used for this line, as a special case. The current indent
    level is not changed.
