This module defines the TreeBuilder, which is used to build() a tree structure
from a text, using a root lexicon.

Using the rebuild() method, TreeBuilder is also capable of regenerating only
part of an existing tree, e.g. when part of a long text is modified through a
text editor. It is smart enough to recognize whether existing tokens before and
after the modified region can be reused or not, and it reuses tokens as much as
possible.

BackgroundTreeBuilder can be used to tokenize a text into a tree in a background
thread.

class TreeBuilder:
    """Build a tree directly from parsing the text.

    The root node of the tree is in the ``root`` instance attribute.

    After calling ``build()`` or ``rebuild()``, three instance variables are set:

        ``start``, ``end``:
            indicate the region the tokens were changed. After build(), start
            is always 0 and end = len(text), but after rebuild(), these values
            indicate the range that was actually re-tokenized.

        ``lexicons``:
            the list of open lexicons (excluding the root lexicon) at the end
            of the document. This way you can see in which lexicon parsing
            ended.

            If a tree was rebuilt, and old tail tokens were reused, the
            lexicons variable is not set, meaning that the old value is still
            valid. If the TreeBuilder was not used before, lexicons is then
            None.

    No other variables or state are kept, so if you don't need the above
    information anymore, you can throw away the TreeBuilder after use.

    ``add_build_updated_callback()``) that are called everytime the whole
    document is tokenized.

    You can also add callbacks to the ``finished_callbacks`` attribute, using
    ``add_finished_callback()``; those are called once when all pending changes
    are processed and then forgotten again.

    To be sure you get a complete tree, call ``get_root()``.
