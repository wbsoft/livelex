"""
The parce Python module.

For parsing tasks and writing language definitions, or using existing language
definitions, the main ``parce`` module provides all that's needed.

So a simple::

    import parce

is sufficient. Inside a language definition, it is easier to just use::

    from parce import *

to get easy access to all the actions and the helper functions.

Besides the classes and functions below, a large amount of *standard actions* is
also available in the ``parce`` module namespace. See for the full list
:doc:`stdactions`.

    If you specify a name, tries to find the language with that name, ignoring

    If you don't specify a name, but instead one or more of the other (keyword)
    arguments, tries to find the language based on filename, mimetype or

    If a language is found, returns the root lexicon. If no language could be

    in an empty token tree).
