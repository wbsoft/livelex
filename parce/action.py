"""
The action module defines two distinct base classes for actions.

StandardAction is the base class for fixed standard actions, and DynamicAction
is the base class for objects that yield actions based on the matched text.

In a parce rule, an action may be any object, e.g. a method, number or string
literal. So it is not necessary that you use the provided standard actions. The
dynamic actions can also be used with your own actions, and you can also
inherit from DynamicAction if you want.

These standard actions are intended to help create a uniform handling of
actions across multiple languages and lexicons.


StandardAction
==============

A StandardAction is a singleton object. Acessing an attribute (without
underscore) creates that attribute as a new instance, with the current instance
as _parent.

This way a new action type can be created that shares its parent with other
types, a concept borrowed from pygments. An example::

    >>> Comment = StandardAction("Comment")
    >>> Literal = StandardAction("Literal")
    >>> String = Literal.String
    >>> String.DoubleQuotedString
    Literal.String.DoubleQuotedString
    >>> String.SingleQuotedString
    Literal.String.SingleQuotedString

StandardAction instances support iteration and membership methods.
Iteration yields the instance ifself and then the parents::

    >>> for i in String.DoubleQuoted:
    ...     print(i)
    ...
    Literal.String.DoubleQuoted
    Literal.String
    Literal

And the :keyword:`in` operator returns True when a standard action belongs to
another one, i.e. the other one is one of the ancestors of the current action::

    >>> String.DoubleQuotedString in String
    True
    >>> Literal in String
    False

The :keyword:`in` operator also works with a string::

    >>> 'String' in Literal.String.DoubleQuoted
    True
    >>> 'Literal' in String
    True

The last one could be surprising, but String is defined as ``Literal.String``::

    >>> String
    Literal.String

Finally, the `&` operator returns the common ancestor, if any::

    >>> String & Number
    Literal
    >>> String & Text
    >>>

See for the full list of pre-defined standard actions :doc:`stdactions`.


DynamicAction
=============

If an instance of DynamicAction is encountered in a rule, its replace()
method is called to yield a (pos, text action) tuple. Sometimes the
replace() method simply calls back the filter_actions() method of the
lexer with the new action, which could again be a DynamicAction instance or
another dynamic rule item.

Nesting is possible in most cases, only some actions require the match object
to be present; and such actions can't be used as default action, or inside
subgroup actions.

A DynamicAction object always holds all actions it is able to return in its
itemlists attribute. This is done so that it is possible to know all actions a
Language can generate beforehand, and e.g. translate all the actions in a
Language to other objects, which could even be methods or functions.
