"""
This module provides the Theme class, which provides text formatting
properties based on the action (standard action) of a Token.

These properties can be used to colorize text according to a language
definition.

By default, the properties are read from a normal CSS (Cascading StyleSheets)
file, although other storage backends could be devised.

Theme provides CSS properties for standard actions, and MetaTheme does
the same, but can have a sub-Theme for every Language.

In the ``themes/`` directory are bundled CSS themes that can be used.
Instantiate a bundled theme with::

    >>> from parce.theme import Theme
    >>> th = Theme.byname("default")

To use a custom CSS theme file, load it using::

    >>> th = Theme('/path/to/my/custom.css')

Get the CSS properties for an action, use e.g.::

    >>> props = th.properties(String)
    >>> props
    {'color': [<Value color='#c00000'>]}

A property value is a list of :py:class:`Value <parce.css.Value>` instances.
As CSS colors can be specified in many different ways, you can call
get_color() to get the color values in (r, g, b, a) format.


Mapping actions to CSS classes
------------------------------

Standard actions are mapped to a tuple of classes: the action itself and
the actions it descends from. All CSS rules are combined, the one with
the most matches comes first.

For example, Comment maps to the "comment" CSS class, and Number maps
to ("literal", "number") because Number is a descendant action of Literal.

Some actions might have the same name, e.g. Escape and String.Escape.
Both match CSS rules with the ``.escape`` class selector, but a rule
with ``.string.escape`` will have higher precedence.

The order of the action names does not matter. E.g. an action Text.Comment
will match exactly the same CSS rules as an action Comment.Text. So you
should take some care when designing you action hierachy and not add too much
base action types.
