"""
This module provides the Theme class, which provides text formatting
properties based on the action (standard action) of a Token.

These properties can be used to colorize text according to a language
definition.

By default, the properties are read from a normal CSS file, although
other storage backends could be devised.

Theme provides CSS properties for standard actions, and MetaTheme does
the same, but can have a sub-Theme for every Language.
