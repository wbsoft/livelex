This module provides the Theme class, which provides text formatting
properties based on the action (standard action) of a Token.

These properties can be used to colorize text according to a language
definition.

By default, the properties are read from a normal CSS file, although
other storage backends could be devised.

    """Return a tuple of lower-case CSS class names for the specified standard action."""
    return tuple(a._name.lower() for a in action)
