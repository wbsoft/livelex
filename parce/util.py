class Dispatcher:
    """Dispatches calls via an instance to methods based on the first argument.

    A Dispatcher is used as a decorator when defining a class, and then called
    via an instance to select a method based on the first argument (which must
    be hashable).

    If you override methods in a subclass that were dispatched, the
    dispatcher automatically dispatches to the new method. If you want to add
    new keywords in a subclass, just create a new Dispatcher with the same
    name. It will automatically inherit the references stored in the old
    dispatcher.

    Usage::

        class MyClass:
            dispatch = Dispatcher()

            @dispatch(1)
            def call_one(self, value):
                print("One called", value)

            @dispatch(2)
            def call_two(self, value):
                print("Two called", value)

            def handle_input(self, number, value):
                self.dispatch(number, value)

        >>> i = MyClass()
        >>> i.handle_input(2, 3)
        Two called 3

    Values of the first argument that are not handled are normally silently
    ignored, but you can also specify a default function, that is called when
    a value is not handled::

        class MyClass:
            @Dispatcher
            def dispatch(self, number, value):
                print("Default function called:", number, value)

            @dispatch(1)
            def call_one(self, value):
                print("One called", value)

            @dispatch(2)
            def call_two(self, value):
                print("Two called", value)

            def handle_input(self, number, value):
                self.dispatch(number, value)

        >>> i = MyClass()
        >>> i.handle_input(3, 10)
        Default function called: 3 10
