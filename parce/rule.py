"""
This module holds a few simple replacable objects that can be put in a rule
and are replaced by other objects depending on the match object of the matched
rule's pattern.

When in a pattern rule an object that inherits from ``DynamicRuleItem`` is
encountered, its ``bymatch()`` method is called with the match object, which
should return a list of items the DynamicRuleItem should be replaced with. This
list is again checked for DynamicRuleItem objects,

In most cases a DynamicRuleItem will be instantiated with a predicate and lists
of replacement objects. The predicate should return an integer index value (or
True or False, which count as 1 and 0, respectively), which determines the list
of replacement values to use.
