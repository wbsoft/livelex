Replacable rule item objects.

A normal rule consists of a pattern, action and zero or more targets.

An action may be any object, a target is either an integer or a lexicon. The
lexicon may be a derived lexicon (i.e. created by calling a vanilla lexicon
with an argument).

This module defines some classes for replacable rule item objects, which can
be used in a rule, and which generate other objects, ultimately resulting in a
normal rule.

These replacable objects can be used to define actions and targets. (For
generated patterns, the :class:`~parce.pattern.Pattern` class from the
:mod:`~parce.pattern` module must be used.)

There are four moments when replaceable rule items are processed:

1. when yielding the rules of the lexicon, in the
   :meth:`~parce.lexicon.__iter__` method of :class:`~parce.lexicon.Lexicon`.

   At this stage, :class:`ArgItem` instances are replaced, by calling their
   ``replace()`` method with the lexicon argument (which is None for a vanilla
   lexicon).

2. when constructing the :meth:`parse` method of the Lexicon, just before
   the first parsing. At this stage, :class:`~parce.pattern.Pattern` objects
   are built by the lexicon.

3. while parsing, when a rule's pattern matches the text. At this moment,
   :class:`DynamicItem` instances are replaced by calling their ``replace()``
   method with both the matched text and the match object (if available).

4. after parsing, :class:`ActionItem` instances are processed. A normal action
   is just paired with the matched text to form a token, but an ActionItem can
   create zero or more tokens, e.g. to match subgroups in a regular expression,
   or to skip some types of text. This is done by the
   :class:`~parce.lexer.Lexer` from the :mod:`~parce.lexer` module.

   When the lexer replaces ``ActionItem`` objects, the replacement objects
   are scanned for ``DynamicItem`` instances as well.

All three Item subclasses, :class:`ArgItem`, :class:`DynamicItem` and
:class:`ActionItem` have their possible replacement objects in their
``itemlists`` attribute. So there are never unexpected objects in a rule, and
rules can always be validated, and e.g. all possible actions can be determined
beforehand.
