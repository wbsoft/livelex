Replacable rule item objects.

Normally a rule consists of pattern, action and zero or more target objects,
where the pattern is a regular expression string or a Pattern object; the
action can be any object and the targets are integers or lexicons.

But it is also possible to have replacable rule items, which are then replaced
before the rule is used.

There are three types of replacable rule item objects (all descending from
RuleItem). All items use the ``replace()`` method to do the replacement work,
but in slightly different ways.

``ArgItem``

    These items are replaced by the lexicon when used for the first time,
    before any parsing occurs, in the :meth:`~parce.lexicon.__iter__` method of
    :class:`~parce.lexicon.Lexicon`. The ``replace()`` method is called with
    the lexicon's argument or None. Replacement lists may consist of patterns,
    action and/or targets. (Although ultimately, for a normal rule, the first
    rule item must be the pattern and the second the action or ActionItem.)

``DynamicItem``

    These items are replaced by the lexicon during parsing. The ``replace()``
    method is called with both the matched text and the match object (if
    available).

``ActionItem``

    These items are replaced by the lexer, after parsing. The ``replace()``
    method is called with lexer, position, text and match values and should
    yield (pos, text, action) tuples to create tokens from.

``DynamicItem`` and ``ActionItem`` must have their possible replacement values
in lists in their ``itemlists`` atttribute. These attributes are scanned before
the items are used in parsing, and so all ``ArgItem`` instances that are in the
itemlists are replaced as soon as a Lexicon is used for the first time.

And when the lexer replaces ``ActionItem`` objects, the replacement objects
are scanned for Dynamic items as well.

Most dynamic and action item types then use a predicate function that returns
the index of the ``itemlists`` to choose.
