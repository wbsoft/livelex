Replacable rule item objects.

When the Lexicon builds its internal representation of the rules,
RuleItem instances are evaluated in two stages. First, the items
are pre-elevated: meaning that the items that depend on the lexicon
argument (the ARG variable) are evaluated.

When a rule matches during parsing, the rest of the items are evaluated
using the TEXT and the MATCH variables.

Only Items that inherit from RuleItem may directly appear in a rule,
and items that they expose (such as the items a :class:`choose` Item chooses
from) must also inherit from RuleItem.

This way, we can be sure that we are able to validate a Lexicon beforehand,
and know all actions or target lexicons that it might yield during parsing.

A third evaluation stage happens in the lexer, for Item objects that inherit
of ActionItem.

The following fixed Item instances are defined here:

``ARG``
    represents the lexicon argument
``MATCH``
    represents the match object of a regular expression match
``TEXT``
    represents the matched text

The match and text variables have some additional functionality:

``MATCH(n)``
    represents the text in a subgroup of the match (subgroups start with 1)
``MATCH(n)[s]``
    represents a slice of the text in a subgroup (fails if the group is None)
``TEXT[s]``
    represents a slice of the matched text

Very often you want to use a predicate function on one of the above
variables, then you need the ``call`` item type:

``call(callable, *arguments)``
    gets the result of calling callable with zero or more arguments

Callable and arguments may also be Item instances.
The ``call`` item type is not allowed directly in a rule, because is not clear
what value it will return. Use it in combination with ``choose``, ``target``,
``pattern`` or dynamic actions (see below).

The following items are RuleItem types (allowed in toplevel in a rule):

``choose(index, *items)``
    chooses the item pointed to by the value in index. The item that ends up in
    a rule is unrolled when it is a list.
``target(value, *lexicons)``
    has a special handling: if the value is an integer, return it (pop or push
    value). If it is a two-tuple(index, arg): derive the lexicon at index with
    arg.

And the following items may also appear in a rule, they survive evaluating,
although the *pre*-evaluation process may alter their attributes:

``pattern(value)``
    only allowed as the first item in a rule; is expected to create a string
    or None. If None, the whole rule is skipped.

``ActionItem(*items)``
    base class for dynamic actions. Those are not evaluated by the Lexicon,
    although the items they contain may be. The lexer takes care of these
    items.

    In some cases you can also return a different Item type when pre-evaluating
    partly succeeds. For example, the :class:`choose` type simply returns the
    chosen item if the index already can be evaluated, without evaluating the
    other items.
