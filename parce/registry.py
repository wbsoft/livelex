This module provides a registry for all the bundled languages.

External language definitions can at runtime also be added to this
registry.

You can find languages based on filename, mimetype, or guess the
language to use based on text contents.

    Use as a class decorator for Language classes you want to add to the

            filenames = ["*.mylang"],

    The following keyword arguments can be specified:

    ``name``
        the name, defaulting to the class name lowercased.
    ``description``
        a description, defaulting to the language class doc string
    ``filenames``
        a list of common filename patterns
    ``mimetypes``
        a list of mime types
    ``guess``
        a list of (regex, priority) tuples. All regular expressions are tried,
        and the highest priority wins (values in the 0..1 range).
    ``root``
        name of the root lexicon, defaulting to "root"

    Other keyword arguments are allowed and may find future use cases.
