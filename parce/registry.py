Registry of language definitions.

Instead of importing language definitions directly, you can use a Registry to
manage and find language definitions.

The registry stores the fully qualified name for a root lexicon, for example
``"parce.lang.css.Css.root"``. This qualified name should have at least 2 dots,
to separate module name, class name and the name of the root lexicon.

Use :func:`find` to find a language definition by name, or :func:`suggest` to
find a language definition for a particular file type. There is basic
functionality to pick a language definition based on file name, mime type
and/or the contents of the file.

Using the :func:`register` function it is possible to register your own
language definitions at runtime and make them available through parce.
As a service, the bundled languages in ``parce.lang`` are automatically
registered in the global registry.

The global Registry is in the ``registry`` module variable.
You can also create and populate your own :class:`Registry`.
