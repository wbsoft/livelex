Registry of language definitions.

You can use the :func:`suggest` function in this module to find a language
definition for a particular file type. There is basic functionality to pick a
language definition based on file name, mime type and/or the contents of the
file.

Using the :func:`register` function it is possible to register your own
language definitions at runtime and make them available through parce.
As a service, the bundled languages in ``parce.lang`` are automatically
registered in the global registry.

The global Registry is in the ``registry`` module variable.
You can also build and populate your own :class:`Registry`.

            The fully qualified name of a root lexicon, e.g.
            ``"parce.lang.css.Css.root"``. Must contain at least two dots.

            A short description
        ``aliases``
            An optional list of other names this lexicon can be found under.
        ``filenames``
            A list of tuples (pattern, weight). A pattern is a plain filename or a
            filename with globbing characters, e.g. ``"Makefile"`` or ``"*.c"``,

            (0..1 range).
        ``guesses``
            A list of tuples (regexp, weight). The first 5000 characters of the
            contents are matched against the regular expression, and when it
            matches, the weight is added to the already computed weight for this
