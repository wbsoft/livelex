Registry of language definitions.

Instead of importing language definitions directly, you can use a Registry to
manage and find language definitions.

The registry stores the fully qualified name for a root lexicon, for example
``"parce.lang.css.Css.root"``. This qualified name should have at least 2 dots,
to separate module name, class name and the name of the root lexicon.

Use :func:`find` to find a language definition by name, or :func:`suggest` to
find a language definition for a particular file type. There is basic
functionality to pick a language definition based on file name, mime type
and/or the contents of the file.

Using the :func:`register` function it is possible to register your own
language definitions at runtime and make them available through parce.
As a service, the bundled languages in ``parce.lang`` are automatically
registered in the global registry.

The global registry is in the :attr:`registry` module variable.
You can also create and populate your own :class:`Registry`.

        ``lexicon_name``
            The fully qualified name of a root lexicon, e.g.
            ``"parce.lang.css.Css.root"``. Must contain at least two dots.

            A short description
        ``aliases``
            An optional list of other names this lexicon can be found under.
        ``filenames``
            A list of tuples (pattern, weight). A pattern is a plain filename or a
            filename with globbing characters, e.g. ``"Makefile"`` or ``"*.c"``,
            and the weight is a floating point value indicating the probability
            that the root lexicon should be chosen for this filename (0..1 range).
        ``mimetypes``
            A list of tuples (mimetype, weight). A mimetype is a string like
            ``"text/css"``, the weight is a floating point value indicating the

            (0..1 range).

            A list of tuples (regexp, weight). The first 5000 characters of the
            contents are matched against the regular expression, and when it
            matches, the weight is added to the already computed weight for this
            root lexicon.
