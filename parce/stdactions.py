actions

base actions, defining the type of text

Text            # just text, with no special styles
Whitespace      # whitespace
Keyword         # a keyword
Delimiter       # a delimiter (mostly a punctuation character)
Name            # a name, e.g. of a function, tag or variable
Value           # a value
Data            # stuff that is more like verbatim data
Comment         # a comment

base actions that can be used alone, but also
appended to other actions, they change the style in some ways.
Some do not change the style, but provide information about the token

Alert           # should stand out, like TODO in a comment
Important       # should stand out somewhat
Unimportant     # something unimportant, could be greyed out
Special         # should stand out somewhat
Definition      # denotes where a thing is defined (vs referred to)
Invalid         # invalid or erroneous input
Escape          # escaped text like \n in a string
Template        # something that is a template for something else
Preprocess      # something that is preprocessed
Inserted        # inserted text (in a diff e.g.)
Deleted         # deleted text (e.g. in a diff)
Quoted          # stuff like a blockquote
Bold            # Bold text
Emphasized      # Emphasized text

those are not styled by default

Start           # denotes the start of something
End             # denotes the end of something
Indent          # denotes an indent
Dedent          # denotes a dedent
