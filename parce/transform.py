Transform/evaluate a tree or a stream of events.

XXX This module is in the planning phase!!

The basic idea of transformation is simple: for every Context in a tree
structure, a method of a Transform instance is called. The method has the same
name as the context's lexicon, and is called with the list of children of that
context, where sub-contexts already have been replaced with the result of
that context's lexicon's transformation method.
So a Transform class can closely mimic a corresponding Language class.

The actual task of transformation (evaluation) is performed by a Transformer.
The Transformer has infrastructure to choose the Transform class based on the
current Language.

Using the :meth:`~Transformer.add_transform` method, you can assign a Transform
instance to a Language class.

TODO: it would be nice to be able to specify the Transform for another Language
inside a Transform, just like a lexicon can target a lexicon from a different
language. But I'm not yet sure how it would be specified.
