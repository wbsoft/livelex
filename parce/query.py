"""
An experimental query module.


Using this module you can query the token tree to find tokens and contexts,
based on lexicons and/or actions and text contents. You can chain calls
in an XPath-like fashion.

This module supplements the various find_xxx methods of every Context object.
A query starts at the `query` property of a Context object, and yields all the
nodes of that Context.

You can navigate using `children`, `all`, `[n]`, `[n:n]`, (`[n:n:n]`),
`next`, `previous`, `right`, `left`, and `parent`. Use `uniq` to remove double
occurrences of nodes, which can e.g. happen when navigating to the parent of
all nodes.

You can narrow down the search using `tokens`, `contexts`, `('text')` or
`(lexicon)`, `has_not`, `[n]`, `[n:n]`, `[action]`, `[action, action]`,
`startingwith()`, `endingwith()`, `containing()`, `matching()`, `uniq`,
`in_action()`,  and the corresponding `not_` counterparts, and `__getitem__`
and `is_not()`.



Examples:

Find all tokens that are the first child of a Context with bla lexicon:

    root.query.all(MyLang.bla)[0]


Find (in Xml) all attributes with name 'name' that are in a <bla> tag:

    root.query.all[Name.Tag]("bla").next('name')


Find all tags containing "hi" in their text nodes:

    root.query.all[Name.Tag].next.next[Text].containing('hi')


Find all comments that have TODO in it:

    root.query.all[Comment].containing('TODO')


A query is a generator, you can iterate over the results. For debugging
purposes, there are also the list(), pick(), count() and dump() methods.

    for attrs in q.all[Name.Tag]('origin').right:
        for atr in attrs.query[Name.Attribute]:
            print(atr)


Summary of the query methods:

Endpoint methods, mainly for debugging:

    count()
        Just prints the number of nodes in the result set

    dump()
        dump()s the full result nodes to stdout

    list()
        aggregate the results in a list

    pick(default=None)
        just pick the first result, or a default if no results


Navigating nodes:

    The query itself yields al children of the Context it was started from.
    But using the following methods you can find your way through a tree
    structure. Every method returns a new Query object, having the previous
    one as source of nodes. Most methods are implemented as properties, so
    you don't have to write parentheses.

    all
        yield all descendant nodes, depth-first, in order. First it yields the
        context, then its children.

    children
        yield all the direct children of the current nodes

    parent
        yield the parent of all current nodes. This can yield double
        occurrences of nodes in the list. (Use uniq to fix that.)

    next, previous
        yield the next or previous Token from the current node, if any

    right, left
        yield the right or left sibling of every current node, if any

    [int], __getitem__(int)
        yield the nth child (if available) of each Context node
        (supports negative indices)

    [slice]
        yield from the specified slice of each Context node

    first, last
        yield the first resp. the last child of every Context node.
        Same as [0] or [-1].

    target
        yield the target context for a token, if any. See Token.target().

    source
        yield the source token for a context, if any. See Context.source().


Selecting (filtering) nodes:

    These methods filter out current nodes without adding new nodes
    to the selection.

    tokens
        select only the tokens

    contexts
        select only the contexts

    uniq
        Removes double occurrences of Tokens or Contexts, which can happen
        e.g. when selecting the parent of all nodes

    filter(predicate)
        select nodes for which the predicate function returns a value that
        evaluates to True

    map(function)
        call function on every node and yield its results, which should be
        nodes as well.

    is_not
        inverts the meaning of the following query, e.g. is_not.startingwith()

    The following query methods are inverted by `is_not`:

    in_range(start=0, end=None)
        select only the nodes that fully fit in the text range. If preceded
        by `is_not`, selects the nodes that are outside the specified text
        range.

    (lexicon, [lexicon, ...])
        select the Contexts with that lexicon (or one of the lexicons)

    ("text"), ("text", ["text2", ...])
        select the Tokens with exact that text (or one of the texts)

    startingwith("text")
        select the Tokens that start with the specified text

    endingwith("text")
        select the Tokens that end with the specified text

    containing("text")
        select the Tokens that contain specified text

    matching("regex")
        select the Tokens that match the specified regular epression
        (using re.search, the expression can match anywhere unless you use
        ^ or $ characters).

    [action], [action, action<, action> ...]
        select the Tokens that have one of the specified actions

    in_action(*actions)
        select tokens if their action belongs in the realm of one of the
        specified StandardActions

    remove_ancestors
        remove Context nodes from the current node list that have descendants
        in the list.

    remove_descendants
        remove nodes from the current list if any of their ancestors is also
        in the list.
