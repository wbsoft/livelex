JavaScript Object Notation parser.

Numbers become Number tokens, ``true``, ``false`` and ``null`` become
Name.Constant tokens, strings are yielded in ``string`` contexts, with String
tokens and possibily String.Escape tokens for escaped characters.

Objects (``{ ... }``) become ``object`` contexts with alternating ``key`` and
``value`` child contexts. Arrays (``[ ... ]``) become ``array`` contexts.
