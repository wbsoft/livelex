The parce module
================

::

   import parce

This Python package, `parce`, can be used for parsing text into tokens using
one of the supplied language definitions in the ``lang`` directory, or
building your own language definitions and parse text using them.

A powerful feature of parce is that you can retokenize only modified parts
of a text if you already have tokenized it. This makes parce suitable for
text editor etc. that need to keep a tokenized structure of the text up-to-date
e.g. to support syntax highlighting as you type.

The module is written and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen.
Python 3.5 and higher is supported.
Testing is done by running ``pytest-3`` in the root directory.

Why the name? It's short, it was available and sounds like 'parse' :-)
