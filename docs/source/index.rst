   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to parce's documentation!
===================================

This module can be used for parsing text into tokens using one of the supplied
language definitions in the ``lang`` directory, or building your own language
definitions and parse text using them

The module is written and maintained by Wilbert Berendsen.
Python 3.5 and higher is supported.
Testing is done by running ``pytest-3`` in the root directory.

Why the name? It's short, not already taken and sounds like 'parse' :-)
